# Citing DigiPal
 The DigiPal Project as a whole should be cited without a specific author: 


* _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_. London, 2011–14. Available at [http://www.digipal.eu/](http://www.digipal.eu/) 

**Blogs and News** should give the individual author, title and year specific to that entry:

For **individual pages** in the website, add the page title as it appears in the browser, in quotes.


* 'Folio: BL Additional 40000, 4r', _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_ (London, 2011–14). Available at &lt;[http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/](https://digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/)&gt;
