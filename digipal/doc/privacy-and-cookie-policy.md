# Privacy and Cookie policy
 The DigiPal website uses cookies to give you a more personal browsing experience. Cookies are small files stored on your computer that remember some of your preferences and actions on the site. DigiPal cookies are not used to identify you personally. 

**By accessing and using this site you consent to the use of cookies on your device as described below unless you have disabled them. You can change your cookie settings at any time but parts of our site will not function correctly without them**.

[General introduction to cookies and how to manage them](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) (third party website).

## Cookies set by DigiPal
There are three main types of cookies:


* **strictly necessary** cookie: without it your device may fail to display essential parts of the site
* **functionality cookie**: enhances the functionality of website by storing your preferences or actions
* **performance cookie**: helps to improve the performance of the website, providing a better user experience

Cookies are also categorised according to their provenance. A cookie is either set directly by the DigiPal site or through services or resources hosted on another web site. The later is called a '**third party** cookie'.
### Security Cookie
We implement a well established measure of prevention against malicious browser requests trying to impersonate your actions (also called [Cross Site Request Forgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)).

### Google Analytics (third-party cookies)
We use Google Analytics software to learn how our users navigate through the DigiPal website. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements.

Google Analytics stores information about:


* the pages you visit on DigiPal - how long you spend on each page 
* how you got to the site 
* what you click on while you’re visiting the site

We don’t collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address), so the information stored by Google Analytics can’t be used to identify who you are.

If you wish to opt out of this then see 'Changing your Cookie Settings' below.


* Cookie names: _utma, _utmb, _utmc, _utmz, ga_nextpage_params
* Type: performance cookie


### Sharing Collections and Annotations (third-party cookies)
When you decide to share your collections and image annotations with other users we use Google URL Shortener service to generate a short URL that is easy for you to copy, paste and send to other people. This Google service sets a few cookies as well.


* Cookie names: GAPS, NID
* Type: functionality cookie


### Disqus (third-party cookies)
We use a third party component to allow the web users to write comments under the Blog and News articles. This component sets its own cookies to identify your browser and interaction history and the connection between DigiPal and their service. More information is available on the [Disqus Privacy Policy page](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy).


* Cookie names: __utma, __utmb, __utmc, __utmv, __utmz, __qca, disqus_unique, __id
* Type: functionality cookie


### Other third-party cookies
Some of our Blog and News articles contain pictures, videos, and media players which are hosted on other web servers (e.g. YouTube). These servers can set their own cookies on your device. We do not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third-party websites for more information.

## Changing your cookie settings
There are different ways to enable or disable cookies from being set. All mainstream Internet browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer, Chrome, FireFox, Safari) offer a settings screen to delete cookies or change which types of cookies can be stored on your device.

[Google also lets you opt-out from its Google Analytics data collection](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
