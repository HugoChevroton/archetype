Temporary todo for the faceted search


JIRA 400: faceted search
    +
        all the facet values are visible
        values have count
        can apply any combination of facets for filtering (previously we were limited to a single content type)
        faster (so far)
        the CTs and views/layouts are not so dependent so we can do more for each CT with less constraints
Other tickets resolved with this one:
    JIRA 125: Page is a full citizen

            char type is empty, character, allograph
    5. CT filter/facet
        how to implement the counts?
            a) with other SQL queries to retrieve the related records from the result set?
                - we have a dual SQL+Whoosh system
                + we can run it asynchronously to improve performance. There will be a small delay on the front end before the counts appear.
            b) with other Whoosh queries on the other content types.
                - might be unnecessarily heavy. But we could have a light version of the query just for that count.
                - this is logically different from a) and c) because we run independent searches. Instead a) and c) will use the ids
                of the records in the result set to find related records.
            c) as part of the same first Whoosh query. Each record will a field for each related content types and the id of the related fields there.
                then we can use whoosh faceting to retrieve the count for each (content type, related record id) and sum them to get a count. Need to
                see how it impacts the performances.
                + single system, single query.
                - we bloat up the index with lots of ids
                - may be slower than other implementations as we have to retrieve and group a lot of ids
                - not parallelisable
    6. Results set columns
        Query phrase only applies to the fields displayed in the result set
        Possibility to add/remove/swap fields in the results set
        Possibility to reorder the fields in the result set
    3. Sorting
        [d] 0. Implement only the default sort order
            [d] define fields in the structure and the transform to get the sortable value
            [d] create new fields in the whoosh schema
        1. Start with simple sort implementation:
            [d] Click on a column to sort by it: up or down
            [d] Then combine that with the default sort fields
            sort by date
            reverse sorting
            show which field is searched by and the direction
        2. full sort options:
            pop up with sortable list of visible fields
            reset button
            a divider b/w sorted and non sorted field
            an arrow to change the sort direction
        How can we le the user chose the fields to be sorted by. E.g. city, repo, shelfmark, folio number?
            a) we could have a pop-up with the list of fields being displayed and let the user reorder them
            b) pre-defined sort orders
            c) match the order of the columns
    Persistent settings
        some of the settings (order of the columns, sorting fields, collapsed/expanded facets) should be persisted across searches
    Optimisation
        Could be greatly optimised by retrieving the values from the hits rather than the database. prefetch_relate helps but it's not as fast.
